			<h2>Weddings</h2>
			<div class = "info">
    			<p>Weddings are such a joyous occasion and each one is different! 
    			The same is true of our wedding cakes. We have an almost unlimited combination 
    			of flavors and styles to choose from. Click here to view our Wedding Cakes 
    			gallery on Facebook.We would love to have you stop by and sample some of our delicious cake.</p>
    			<p> Batters and fillings: Our most popular batter is yellow, but we also offer red velvet, 
    			chocolate, marble, and others upon request. As for fillings, we recommend white buttercream 
    			icing, chocolate fudge icing, strawberry crème filling, vanilla pastry cream, or one of several 
    			fruit fillings (lemon, raspberry, apricot, strawberry, etc.). That being said, if you have 
    			something special in mind it can’t hurt to ask!</p>
				<p>Sizes: To keep proportionality and maintain structure, wedding cakes come in certain 
				sizes with certain tier dimensions. If the size of the wedding party falls in between cake 
				sizes, we can offer additional sheet cakes up to the amount of slices required.</p>
				<p>Pricing: Our wedding cakes vary in price, depending on type, size, and “extras” 
				such as special fillings, pillars, etc. For example, the cakes seen above are in the 
				$3.25 – $3.75 per serving range.</p>

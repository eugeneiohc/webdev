    		<h1>About Us</h1>
    		<div class = "info-about">
    			<p>Prantl’s Bakery is a Pittsburgh institution. Its “Burnt Almond Torte” 
    			and 100+ sinful sweets have been a tradition for the last 40 years. In 
    			fact, there’s been a bakery in continuous operation at the flagship 
    			Shadyside store for over 100 years. Prantl’s is a bakery in the German 
    			tradition, with old-fashioned fruit Danish and nut-filled coffeecakes, 
    			but we can’t help but get excited about some of our “new favorites” as 
    			well, like key lime pie and our buttery croissants. In addition to our 
    			mouth watering special order cakes, we are famous for our “Burnt Almond 
    			Torte”, which was conceived by Henry Prantl after a trip to California. 
    			There was an almond glut the year he went and the Almond Board was trying 
    			to get bakers to use almonds in new and inspiring ways. Henry picked up 
    			a few ideas and brought them back to Pittsburgh where he refined them 
    			into our current recipe for “Burnt Almond Torte”, a unique and addictive 
    			dessert. If you’ve never had one, you really do have to try one. If you 
    			have had one, you know what we’re talking about!</p>
				<p>Henry and Jane Prantl retired from the business in 2007. The bakery is 
				now owned and operated by John M. Felice, who strives to maintain the 
				tradition of high quality baked goods. We hope you agree . . .</p>
